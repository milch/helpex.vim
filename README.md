helpex.vim
==========

Scripts to integrate helpex into vim

Installation
------------

 - `git clone --recursive https://github.com/sanmiguel/helpex.vim`
 - `cd /path/to/helpex.vim`
 - `cd helpex`
 - `mix do deps.get, compile, release`
 - Add helpex.vim to your `runtimepath` as usual. If you use an addon manager for vim, you'll currently need to manually perform this last build step manually.

Issues
------

 - Assumes you have [helpex](https://github.com/sanmiguel/helpex) installed on your `$PATH`
 - No error checking
 - No options
