Scripts to integrate helpex into vim

Installation
------------

 - `git clone https://github.com/sanmiguel/helpex.vim`
 - Add helpex.vim to your `runtimepath` as usual. If you use an addon manager for vim, you'll currently need to manually perform this last build step manually.

Issues
------

 - Requires elixir > v1.0.4 (i.e. master) due to [this commit](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/8e65562808fe80b0c481dbfcf40e66b8c8872c67)
 - Requires [https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim](vimproc)
